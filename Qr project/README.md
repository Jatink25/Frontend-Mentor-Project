## 🚀 My Process

### 🛠 Built with

* Semantic HTML5
* Plain CSS (no frameworks)
* Flexbox for centering
* HSL color system
* Mobile-friendly layout

### 💡 What I learned

While building this project, I strengthened my understanding of:

* Centering elements using Flexbox (`display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center;`)
* Using `vw` and `vh` for full-screen layouts
* Working with HSL colors instead of RGB
* Creating clean card-style UI with `border-radius` and `box-shadow`
* Structuring components with reusable containers

Example of my main layout:

```css
.Qr{
    width: 100vw;
    height: 100vh;
    background:  hsl(212, 45%, 89%);
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
}
```

## 🔄 Continued Development

In future projects, I want to:

* Add proper mobile breakpoints using media queries
* Learn CSS Grid alongside Flexbox
* Improve typography and spacing systems
* Start using variables for colors and spacing
